## Integration with Wardrobe App

This reselling functionality would integrate seamlessly with the existing wardrobe app by:

1. **Adding a "Resell" tab** to each item in the wardrobe
2. **Providing instant price estimates** when users consider selling
3. **Suggesting items to resell** based on wear patterns and market demand
4. **Creating a "Reselling Queue"** for items users want to sell
5. **Tracking reselling success** as part of the wardrobe wellness metrics

## User Journey Example:

1. User opens their wardrobe and sees a dress they haven't worn in 6 months
2. App suggests: "This dress is trending! You could sell it for $45-65 on Poshmark"
3. User clicks "Resell" and sees:
   - Current market prices across all platforms
   - Best platform recommendation (Poshmark for this item)
   - Optimal listing price ($52)
   - Best time to list (next 2 weeks)
   - Automated listing template
4. User can list directly from the app or get a detailed action plan
5. App tracks the sale and updates wardrobe analytics

This approach transforms reselling from a frustrating, time-consuming process into an intelligent, data-driven decision that maximizes profit while minimizing effort.
